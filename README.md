## Rooms of a House: Project One for Interaction Design
#### by Natalie Morris



### Overview
This program navigates you throw a series of six "rooms" simulated by mood states that draw pngs on the user's screen. The user uses the mouse to click on buttons that allow them to explore the different rooms. They can also press a play button that allows them to sit back and have the rooms auto-navigate like a slideshow.


### Technical Details

This program uses mood states to build the rooms, draw functions to decorate them and place buttons, and a timer function to allow it to autoplay.
